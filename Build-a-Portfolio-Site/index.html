            <p>I am a Junior System Analyst at Software Practices Laboratory - SPLab. I work in the Term Monitor project, a partnership between the SPLab and the Ingenico Group. My role in that project is to manage, with another work partner, a small, but very efficient and competent team, leading this group to develop and improve applications for payment solutions.

              Formerly I've worked for two years mainly with Android application testing and web application development across a couple of teams(e.g. Sony, Asus and Compal teams) at Embedded Laboratory. On those projects I had the opportunity to experiment and use tools such as Google Espresso for automated tests and TestLink for reporting of test cases, test suites, execution of test scenarios and such. Also I used to work with AnguarJS framework along with HTML5, CSS3, JQuery and Twitter Bootstrap to build a web application service to managing marketing campaigns for the Android platform.
              Most recently I started to play around with ReactJS, and currently I am enrolled in a Nanodegree in web front-end development at Udacity website to improve my front-end development skills. That Nanodegree is a partnership among Udacity, AT&T, Google, Github and Hack Reactor.

              During my undergraduate I had one of the greatest opportunity of my life. I went to the USA and took Computer Science classes as part of my undergraduate studies.

                  <p>I worked as a Junior Android Application Tester as well as a Web Application Developer at Embedded Laboratory. I was responsible to create and execute test plans on Android applications and Android games, using Espresso testing framework to automate UI tests in order to assure that the behavior of the apps was in accordance with what it was specified and required by the client. I was also responsible to perform automated tests in web applications using the Protractor framework. In addition, I got involved in the development of a web system using AngularJS framework for UI development and to manage all the front-end logic, and the Django framework to deal with the development of the back-end part. That web system was aimed for managing Android commercial campaigns.</p>
