                Hi! I'm Laércio (the smiley guy in the photo above). I am a Front-End Web developer. I've started to play around and
                work with web development about 2+ years ago. Since then I've get involved in a bunch of projects working on
                development of web components and web aplications as a whole, and sometimes doing some testing as well. During all this
                time I've used some tools and technologies that helped me to achieve the desired results in a more feasible way. Some
                of those tools were: the Angular framework, versions 1.x and 4, languages and technologies such as HTML5, CSS3,
                JavaScript, the Twitter Bootstrap framework, and some other tools.
              </span>
            </p>

              <p>I'm passionate about learning. I study every single day and I strive everyday to become a better programmer/software
              engineer. I study things from machine learning to web development, from CSS to MongoDB, from how to repair a pair of
              shoes to how to invest money in an effective and profitable way. So I'm really open to any kind of knowledge and I always
              try to keep my mind open to new opportunities.</p>

              <p>If you want to know more about me, in the bottom of this page you can access my profiles on social medias. Feel free
                 to contact me at: laerciovitorino at gmail dot com</p>

                    I was responsible to create and execute test plans on Android applications and Android games, using the Espresso
                    testing framework to automate UI tests in order to assure that the behavior of the apps was in accordance with
                    what was specified and required by the client. I was also responsible to perform automated tests on web
                    applications using the Protractor framework. In addition, I got involved in the development of a web application
                    using AngularJS(1.x) framework for UI development and to manage all the front-end logic; and the Django framework
                    to deal with the development of the back-end part. That web application was aimed for managing Android commercial
                    campaigns by the Asus stakeholders.</p>
